# No More a Love Victim - Novel

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
The story revolves around the heroine, Grace, who once had what seemed to be a happy family. Her husband, Antonio, and their son, Alaric, were her whole world. However, on Alaric’s fifth birthday, a kidnapping shattered her illusion of happiness.

To save her son, Grace willingly became a hostage, enduring inhumane torture and even losing a kidney. But she never expected that behind the kidnapping was a conspiracy one orchestrated by the very people she trusted most. Her husband and son had sacrificed her health to save Antonio’s first love, Adela.

Lying on the operating table, Grace overheard their conversation, and the truth pierced her heart like a sharp blade. She realized that the happiness she had cherished was nothing more than a carefully woven lie. Devastated, she decided to leave the family that had betrayed her and start a new life abroad.

However, in her absence, Antonio and Alaric gradually realized their mistakes. In an effort to atone, Antonio even donated his own kidney to her. But by then, Grace had already lost all faith in them. Determined to seek justice, she took legal action and ultimately sent Antonio to prison.
