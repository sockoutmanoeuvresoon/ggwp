After Running Away with a Baby, I Became a Rich Heiress Wife - Novel | Kathy Holman, my only sister, fell head over heels for The Prince of the Capital’s Elite Circle at first sight. Just to create an opportunity, she didn’t hesitate to drug him at a banquet. I didn’t stop her at that time. In fact, I even gave her a hand to deliver the drugged drink. To top it off, I thoughtfully booked a luxurious suite to carry out for her plan.

In my previous life, I tried to intervene when I saw her spiking the drink, warning her that the Miles Family wielded so much influence, both in the legal and underground worlds. That means, messing with them would be equal to courting death. That night, however, Chester Miles ended up spending the night with another woman. By the next day, he was engaged with said woman in a flash announcement.

My sister said nothing out loud about it. On the way home, however, she pushed me off an overpass. I was killed on the spot, my body crushed under a speeding truck. In my final moments, she screamed at me, accusing me of ruining her chance to marry into a wealthy family. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back at the banquet on that fateful day. This time, I was determined to watch her dig her own grave!
